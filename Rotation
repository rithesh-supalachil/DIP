Write a program to perform linear transformation on an image.

# Importing the opencv library
import cv2

# Reading the file
# Link for image: https://ibb.co/sCYh1vn
image = cv2.imread('/content/drive/MyDrive/ImageProcess/Lab/Images/image_ncc_1_lq.jpg')
cv2.imshow(image)

# Extracting the height and width from image
height, width = image.shape[:2]
  
# Get the center coordinates of the image
center = (width/2, height/2)
  
# Get the rotation matrix
rotate_matrix = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(center=center, angle=90, scale=1)
  
# Rotating the image 90 degree counterclockwise
rotated_image = cv2.warpAffine(src=image, M=rotate_matrix, dsize=(width, height))
  
# display the image
cv2_imshow( rotated_image )

# save the updated image
# cv2.imwrite('rotated_image.jpg', rotated_image)
